Android-1887ChristmasTree
=========================

Wrote this app to talk to my Arduino which controlled the house Christmas Tree. The tree was also a chat server

Basically this little app makes a TCP connection and reads/writes bytes from/to that connection.
There's buttons that send predefined bytes and a text box to send arbitrary characters.
